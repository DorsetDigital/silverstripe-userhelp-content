# SilverStripe User Help! #

## Welcome! ##

If you are creating content or managing a website built with SilverStripe CMS, you have come to right place. [SilverStripe CMS](http://www.silverstripe.org/introduction/) User Help is a reference for editors and administrators of SilverStripe websites. We hope you find it useful.

**Please note that this version of user help applies to SilverStripe CMS 3.0 and higher. If your site is running on an older version of SilverStripe CMS, you may want to refer to the previous version of User Help for SilverStripe CMS 2.4 at [2.4.userhelp.silverstripe.org](http://2.4.userhelp.silverstripe.org/) or 2.3 at [2.3.userhelp.silverstripe.org](http://2.3.userhelp.silverstripe.org/).**

This user help also covers a number of [modules](http://www.silverstripe.org/modules) which may or may not be installed for your site. Refer to the intro for each chapter to find out the prerequisites for using a feature.

If you are a developer, we encourage you to join the [SilverStripe development community](http://www.silverstripe.org/forums/) as the first port of call for help.
