# SilverStripe CMS user help guide
This site is a user-focused reference targeted at editors and administrators who create and manage content on SilverStripe CMS websites.
This guide applies to version 3.x of the CMS (all releases in the SilverStripe 3 release line).

This user help also covers a number of [modules](https://addons.silverstripe.org)
which may or may not be installed for your site. Refer to the intro for each chapter to find out the prerequisites for using a feature.

If you are a developer, we encourage you to join the
[development community](https://www.silverstripe.org/community/forums/) as the first port of call for help,
and visit our [developer documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org).

Customers of SilverStripe Ltd., the company behind the CMS, should visit [silverstripe.com](https://www.silverstripe.com/).
