## Welcome!

This site is a user-focused reference for the [SilverStripe](http://www.silverstripe.org/introduction/) CMS and Framework.
It is targeted at editors and administrators who create and manage content on SilverStripe websites. 
This guide applies to version 3.0 and higher, for older versions please visit [2.4.userhelp.silverstripe.org](http://2.4.userhelp.silverstripe.org/).

which may or may not be installed for your site. 
Refer to the intro for each chapter to find out the prerequisites for using a feature.

If you are a developer, we encourage you to join the
