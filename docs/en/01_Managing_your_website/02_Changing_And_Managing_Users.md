In the **New Member** section, you can edit the user's details. The two most important parts of the user details are the user's email (which is also used for logging in) and password.

<div class="note" markdown="1">
### Notes:

Users can be in multiple groups. If you delete a user from a group, they are only removed from that group, not from the system. To fully delete a user from the system, you need to be in the root of Security.

Click the link ***Security*** in the breadcrumbs or click the button ***Back*** which is shown as a left arrow icon.

## Changing a user's password

To change a user's password, navigate to the ***Users*** tab, and select the user you would like to edit.

Click the link ***Change password*** to expand a password field and a confirm password field. Change the password and confirm it (both must match) and click the button ***Save***.
