# Reordering page structure

## Moving pages with drag and drop

1. Navigate to the **Pages** section within the main menu ![pages tab single](/_images/pages-tab-single.png)

2. Drag a page to it's new position within the site tree.

You can either drag and drop:
 * **in-between** two other pages.
 * **on top of** a page, which will move the page inside that section, as a subpage.

3. Select the moved page and click the button ***Publish***. Although the page has been moved, the changes will not be reflected on the site until selecting ***Publish***.

You can also change the section a page appears within, without having to use drag and drop:
 1. Select the page you want to move, to enter edit mode.
 2. Click the ***Settings*** tab.
 3. Select **Page location** and choose whether you would like this page to appear as a "Top-level page", or a "Sub-page underneath a parent page".
 4. Click ***Publish***.
