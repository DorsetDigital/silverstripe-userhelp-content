title: Unpublishing pages
summary: Removing pages from the live website without deleting the draft content.
introduction: If you want to temporarily remove a page from the live site, for example if you accidentally click Publish too soon, or if the page is no longer required on the live site, but will be again in the future, you can Unpublish it.

## Unpublishing pages

1. Select the page you want to unpublish, click the button ***More options*** which is shown as a ellipses icon.

2. Select the option **Unpublish** and the page will be removed from the Draft site.
3. You can add any required changes, and click the button ***Save*** which will save those changes without making the page live.
4. Click the button ***Publish*** when you want to republish the page to the live site again.

### How do I know which pages have been unpublished?

Pages that exist on the Draft site, but are not yet on the live site, will be marked with a **Draft** label in the site tree.

When you create a new page, it will only exist on the Draft site, until you click the button ***Publish***.

If you have no plans to re-publish the page in the near future, you can **Unpublish and archive** and recover the page at a later date, see [Restoring archived pages](restoring_archived_pages) to learn more.
