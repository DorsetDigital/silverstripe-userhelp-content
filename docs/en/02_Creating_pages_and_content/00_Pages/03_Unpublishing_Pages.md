title: Unpublishing pages
summary: Removing pages from the live website without deleting the draft content.
introduction: If you wish to temporarily remove a page from the live site, for example if you accidentally clicked on Save & Publish too soon, or if the page is no longer required on the live site, but shall be again in the future, you can Unpublish it.

# Unpublishing pages

## Quick Reminder

 1. Click on ![more options](/_images/more-options.png) at the bottom
 2. Click on ![unpublish link](/_images/unpublish-link.png)

## Unpublish

 1. While in the edit mode for a page, click on ![more options](/_images/more-options.png) at the bottom.
 2. Select ![unpublish link](/_images/unpublish-link.png), and the page shall be removed from the Draft site.

You can then make changes as you wish, and clicking ![save draft button](/_images/save-draft-button.png) shall save those changes without making the page live.

As soon as you wish to republish the page to the live site again, simply click on the ![save/publish](/_images/save-publish.png) button.

### How do I know which pages have been unpublished?

Pages that exist on the Draft site, but are not yet on the live site, shall be marked with a ![draft label](/_images/draft-label.png) label in the site tree.

Note: When in editing mode, only labels for the current page are displayed in the Site Tree. To view labels for all other pages, you must click on the ![pages tab single](/_images/pages-tab-single.png) tab.

When you create a new page, it shall exist only on the Draft site, until you click on the save ![save/publish](/_images/save-publish.png).

If you don't have any plans to re-publish the page in the near future, perhaps you'd be better off just Deleting the page (you can always restore it later if you change your mind!).
