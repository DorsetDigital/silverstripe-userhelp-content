title: Rolling Back to a Previous Page Version
summary: Viewing the history, comparing changes and rolling back to old page versions.
introduction: Anytime you ***Save*** or ***Publish*** a snapshot of the page is created that can be rolled back to at any point in the future. This is useful for undoing any saved changes or recovering any content that had previously been removed.

# Rolling Back to a Previous Page Version

## Rolling back

1. Select a page you want to roll back to in the site tree and navigate to the ***History*** tab. You will see a list of each version of the page in the left sidebar, along with the pages date, and the user who published it.
2. Select a version to preview. If you select the **Show unpublished versions** checkbox field, the list will also display snapshots from when users clicked Save.
You can preview how the current snapshot looked on the site, by switching to **Preview** mode using the edit mode toggle.
3. Click the button ***Revert to this version***, once you have located the snapshot that you want to roll back to.
4. The page will be rolled back to this version. Click the button ***Publish*** to make it live.

When a page is rolled back to the previous version, it is only rolled back in the backend CMS as a draft. To show the rolled back page on the public-facing website, it needs to be published.

## Comparing Snapshots

To see exactly what was changed between 2 different versions of the page:

1. Navigate to the ***History*** tab, select the **Compare mode** checkbox field.
2. Select 2 different snapshots from the left sidebar. To deselect a snapshot, select it again.
3. The preview on the right will then highlight everything that has been removed from the page in red, and everything that was added in green.
