title: Rolling Back to a Previous Page Version
summary: Viewing the history, comparing changes and rolling back to old page versions.
introduction: Whenever you click the Save draft or Save & publish buttons a snapshot of the page is created that can be rolled back to at any point in the future. This is useful for undoing any saved changes or recovering any content that had previously been removed.

## Rolling back

Note: If you tick the Show unpublished versions checkbox, the list will also display snapshots from when users clicked on Save Draft. You can preview how the current snapshot looked on the site, by switching to Preview mode using the mode toggle in the bottom right-hand corner.
 3. When you have located the snapshot that you'd like to roll back to, just click on the ![revert version button](/_images/revert-version-button.png) button.

When a page is rolled back to the previous version, it is only rolled back in the backend CMS as a draft. To show the rolled back page on the public-facing website, it needs to be published by pressing "Save and Publish."

 2. Then select 2 different snapshots from the list on the left. Note: To deselect a snapshot, just click on it again.
 3. The preview on the right will then highlight everything that has been removed from the page in red, and everything that was added in green.
