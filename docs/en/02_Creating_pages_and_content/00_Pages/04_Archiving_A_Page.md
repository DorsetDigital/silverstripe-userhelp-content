summary: Removing pages from both the draft and live sites.

# Archiving a page
Any page in the CMS can be archived, which removes it from both the staging and live sites, but retains the page in the internal version history.

### Archiving pages

1. Select the page you want to archive, click the button ***More options*** which is shown as a ellipse icon.
2. Click the button ***Unpublish and archive***.

The page will be removed from the live and draft sites, and will be shown in the site tree with the label **Archived**. At any point you can restore the page. Select the page and click the button ***Restore draft***. As soon as the CMS interface is reloaded, the archived page will no longer appear in the site tree. However, it is still possible to recover any archived pages at a later date, see [Restoring archived pages](restoring_archived_pages) to learn more.
