# Searching for pages

To search for a page, click on the ![Filter](/_images/filter.png) at the top right and enter your search into the "Content" entry form in the page "filter" panel.

The default search mode is by text, and you can type any text to search your pages for that text. Pressing search will show only positive results in the Page Tree on the "Pages" pane.

Search results will remain the only items in the Page List View until the "Clear" button is pressed.
