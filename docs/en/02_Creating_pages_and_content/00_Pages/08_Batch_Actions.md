# Batch actions

## Publishing multiple pages

To publish multiple pages, you can follow the same steps as in the archiving multiple pages step.

When viewing the tree, select "Publish" from the batch actions dropdown.
Check all the pages you want to publish, and then click the go button next to the drop-down.

### Archiving multiple pages

To archive or unpublish multiple pages, you can use the bulk action tool on the
"Pages" pane. This can be accessed either by clicking "Pages" in the main menu
or "Edit Tree" when editing a page.

From the "Actions" drop-down menu at the top of the "Pages" pane, choosing
"Archive" or "Unpublish". Available pages for the select action will have a checkbox
disabled beside them.

Select any number of pages, and then press "Go" to perform the selected action.
