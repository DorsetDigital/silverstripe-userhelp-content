title: Campaigns
summary: Create and group new content together to be released all at once.

# Campaigns overview

The Campaigns section of the CMS is new as of SilverStripe 4.

Campaigns allow for a set of pages on your site to be viewed and published as a collection. Items in a campaign could contain varying types of content including pages, files, data, content blocks, and forms. By default most content types can be added to a campaign but this will depend on how your data structures have been defined.

Campaigns enable:
* individuals or team to have easier visibility of a collection of content they need to work on or maintain
* reviewing a collection of work as draft
* publishing of content simultaniously 

Note: As this section of the CMS is relatively new it will continue to develop, for example, two planned features to be added will be scheduled publishing and permissions/settings of a campaign.
