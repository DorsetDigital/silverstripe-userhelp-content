summary: Create and group new content together to be released all at once.

# Starting a New Campaign

The Campaigns section of the CMS is a new feature as of SilverStripe 4.

Campaigns allow for a set of pages on your site to be viewed and published as a collection. Items in the campaign could contain varying types of content including pages, files, data, content blocks, and forms. By default most types of content will be able to be added to a campaign but will depend on how your data structures have been defined.

Benefits the creation process:
* Work on a collection of content as an individual or as a team.
* Review a collection of work
* Publish the Campaign

This helps authors have a better view of the things they need to take action on, and also providing the ability to publish the Campaign as a whole at one time.

This section helps those who need to review  , without the slow process of lots of emailing back and forth. Also, we wanted to provide visibility to teams of where different work streams are at
