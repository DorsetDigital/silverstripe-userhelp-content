# Web browser differences

It's highly recommended to use either [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) or [Mozilla FireFox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/) as your web browser, as Internet Explorer doesn't support some features such as inserting multiple images at once, or resizing images whilst maintaining their proportions.

[Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome) and [Mozilla FireFox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/) are also generally faster, more secure browsers, so I'd highly recommend using one instead of Internet Explorer for your everyday browsing as well.
