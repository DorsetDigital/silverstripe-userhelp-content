## Previewing your changes

After you save your page, you can preview the page by selecting either **Preview mode** or **Split mode** in the toggle ***Edit mode***.

This will allow you to view a preview of your draft content alongside the Page management section. That way you can make live updates to the Draft site and see the preview immediately.
