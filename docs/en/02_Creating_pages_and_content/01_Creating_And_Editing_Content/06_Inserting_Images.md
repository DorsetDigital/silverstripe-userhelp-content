<div class="note" markdown="1">
Image files for a website must be in either JPG, GIF or PNG format. If your image currently exists in a Word or Publisher file, you must first save the image as one of these file types, usually by right clicking on it, and selecting Save as Picture...</div>

<div class="note" markdown="1">
If you are using Internet Explorer, you should only select 1 image to insert at a time. Also Internet Explorer isn't able to resize images while keeping it's proportions, so you may wish to use another browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla FireFox, or use the Edit interface (see below) to manually enter it's size.

## Setting the alignment of an image

 1. After the images have uploaded in step 5 above, click on the ![image edit](/_images/image-edit.png) link next to an image.
 2. You can then choose from various alignments in the Alignment / style dropdown.
 3. Click ![insert button](/_images/insert-image-button.png) as normal, to insert the image

## Changing the alignment of an image that's already been inserted

To change the alignment of an image that you have already inserted into a page:

 1. Click on the image in the Content box to select it, little square drag handles should appear on the image.
 2. Click on the ![insert icon](/_images/insert-media-icon.png)Insert Media icon.
 3. A box will open allowing you to change the alignment settings of the image.
 4. Click ![update button](/_images/update-button.png)

## Repositioning an Image

To change the position of an image that you have already inserted, simply **click and drag** it, moving the text cursor to the position you'd to move the image to. Then release the mouse button. Remember, the **text cursor position only defines the position of the top of the image**, so you're best dragging it to the very start of a paragraph, or onto it's own line. To change the left/right alignment of the image, see above.
