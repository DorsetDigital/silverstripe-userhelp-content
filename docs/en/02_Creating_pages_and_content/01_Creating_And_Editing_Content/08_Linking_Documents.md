summary: Uploading and linking documents from the SilverStripe CMS.

## Uploading and linking to documents

To upload documents, such as PDF files, Word .DOC documents, and downloadable audio and video files, navigate to the **Files** area in the CMS menu.

Note: Be sure to Save any page you are working on in the editing page to a Draft before doing so, otherwise you may lose any changes you have made since the last save.

Click the button ***Upload***, see [Uploading images from Files](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/4/creating_pages_and_content/working_with_images_and_documents/#uploading-images) to learn more.
Note: the same process applies to all file types.

1. Navigate to the **Pages** section within the CMS menu and select the page you want to add a hyperlink to in the site tree.
2. Highlight the text or click where you would like to add the hyperlink. You can either:
 * Click the button ***Hyperlink*** which is shown as a link icon in the HTML editor.
